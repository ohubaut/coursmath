<a name="help"></a><h3>Comment utiliser LiveGraphics3D :</h3>
Notez que "gauche","droit" indique le bouton de la souris à maintenir, et "Shift","Ctrl" indique de plus la touche à maintenir enfoncée.
<ul><li>glissez-gauche pour mouvoir le globe autour d'un axe ; si vous relâchez le bouton pendant le glissage (comme si on lançait une toupie), la rotation continue tant le pointeur reste sur l'applet (elle reprend quand le pointeur y revient),</li>
<li>Shift-glissez-gauche horizontalement pour tourner autour d'un axe perpendiculaire à l'image,</li>
<li>Shift-glissez-gauche verticalement pour <u>zoomer</u>,</li>
<li>Ctrl-glissez-gauche verticalement pour modifier la distance focale,</li>
<li>la touche "F" est la bascule de passage en "<u>polyèdre fil</u>" (seules les arêtes sont affichées),</li>
<li>glissez-droit verticalement pour <u>supprimer des faces</u> d'un polyèdre,</li>
<li>la touche "S" est la bascule de passage en vision stéréo ; Ctrl-glissez-gauche horizontalement pour modifier l'effet stéréo ;</li>
<li>une éventuelle <u>animation</u> est déclenchée par le pointeur, et s'arrête si le pointeur quitte l'image ; un double clic gauche sert de bascule pour arrêter ou reprendre l'animation : une fois arrêtée, on peut contrôler l'animation par glissez-droit horizontalement ;</li>
<li>certaines figures peuvent être <u>modifiées dynamiquement</u> : arrêtez le mouvement (cliquez sur le dessin), puis glissez-gauche un des gros points pour le déplacer (l'apparition d'un petit carré centré sur le point permet de repérer facilement un tel point).</li></ul>
